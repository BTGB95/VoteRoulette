# Each reward can have:

# - a list of permission groups the reward will be considered for
# You can leave out any of these options if you do not wish to use them
#
#Example reward:
#    Awesome Reward: -- Name of the reward
#        items: 264(10), 276, 364(16) —- This one gives 10 diamonds, a diamond sword, and 16 steak 
#        currency: 100 —- $100 in-game currency (if vault is installed)
#        xpLevels: 5 —- Player will gain 5 xp levels
#        permGroups: Members, Donators —- Only players in the ‘Members’ or ‘Donators’ permission groups are eligible for the reward

        items: 264(1)

#    Lame Reward:
#        items: 3(64)

# Set the following to true if you want a reward to be chosen at random (see rewards list below)
giveRandomReward: true

# Use to set the default reward. (This is for if you have “giveRandomReward” set to false.)
defaultReward: ‘Default Reward’

# Set the following to true if you only want players to get rewarded after they vote so many times
# For example, you want them to vote on all your server lists before getting rewarded
# If this is false, players will receive an award every time they vote
giveRewardsOnThreshold: false

# If the above is set to true, this is the number of how many votes till a player will receive a reward
voteThreshold: 5

##Milestones List##
#
# Milestones are special rewards that are given after so a player has made so many votes
# They are created in the config the same way as regular rewards, however you must include
# a “votes: #“ section with how many votes you want the milestone to be! The milestone will otherwise 
# be ignored. You can also include a “recurring: true” section to have the milestone recur upon multiples
# For example, if the votes is set to 50 and recurring is true, players will receive this reward every 50 votes! (50, 100, 150, etc)
#

Milestones:

#    Default Milestone:
#        votes: 50
#        currency: 100
#        recurring: true
#        priority: 10

# Set this to true to if you set multiple milestones with the same vote count and you want a random one to be chosen (if false, the first will be chosen)     
giveRandomMilestone: true

# Set the following to false if you want players to get a regular reward on top of a milestone reward when they reach a milestone.
onlyRewardMilestoneUponCompletion: true
